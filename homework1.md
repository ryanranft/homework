The name of the company I have chosen is citadel. Citadel was founded in 1990 by Ken Griffin. The company began under the name Wellington Financial Group and began with 4.6 million in capital. Citadel manages 50 billion in assets under management. Hedge funds like citadel are funded by high-net-worth individuals. It took on its first outside investors this year. Citadel makes money by using high frequency trades. They make money by using high speed internet connection to take advantage of small differences in bid/ask prices that exist because of high volume trades. Citadel is an institutional investor that participates in dark pools Institutional investors are the intended customers who are the only participants in the dark pools. Citadel participates in Dark pools which are private markets that allow large companies to trade millions of shares of stock at one time without the large trade shocking the market for retail investors. The large institutional investors could take advantage of the options market. Their large trades occur throughout a long period of time to make the trades invisible to the retail investors. The participants in the dark pools would be able to reverse engineer the algorithm they made to sell a large number of shares in the dark pool to leverage the options markets that are available to the general public. The dark pool participants are relying on high fiber optic cables that are routed to the public markets. The shorter the cable, the more leverage they have over other institutional investors. If the competitor can execute a trade in the New York Stock Exchange before a different company by clicking enter at the same time, that is an expensive trade. The major competitors in the high frequency trading domain are Virtu Financial, Tower Research Capital, IMC, and Tradebot. Some of the major trends and innovations that have occured in this domain over the last 5-10 years have been made away from the public eye because of the gray ethical concerns this brings to capitalism. The day after Flash Boys by Michael Lewis was published, the FBI raided Citadel and began an investigation into their dark pools. These orders within the latent dark pools have become so large in recent years that the Chicago Tribune has published an article saying the dark pools target small retail investors. The banks are selling their own shares of stock in their own dark pools, possibly making a two-sided market. The impact of the trades in dark pools is unknown because the algorithm created to execute the trades is designed to hide evidence. The SEC and FBI prodes into this will reveal more in the coming years. Citadel is a mega-hedge fund and year over year its earnings show why it is the best reporting $28 billion in revenue for 2022. If I was advising Citadel as to what products or services they should use, I would advise them to invest in the best lawyers money can buy. I would advise them to use game theory to figure out how the laws that will be made in the wake of the SEC's new guidelines regarding their dark pools will change the market as a whole. Too big to fail was created in the wake of the 08' recession and it was named Dark pools. The lawyers and lawmakers probably have a good idea already as to how they will change the laws, but when you change the laws that only changes how people will abuse the laws to find a competitive advantage. When big banks are in volitale waters that can lead to chaos resulting in wars in second and third level causation. If high frequency trading was eliminated, I would assume the company would need to add more financial advisors to their team to recruit more high net worth investors. I think technology would be phased out. If it was possible for HFT's to be eliminated and the market was fair, I do not think the financial world would need as many people with technology backgrounds.
