The name of the company I have chosen is citadel. Citadel was founded in 1990 by Ken Griffin. The company began under the name Wellington Financial Group and began with 4.6 million in capital. Citadel manages 50 billion in assets under management. Hedge funds like citadel are funded by high-net-worth individuals. It took on its first outside investors this year. Citadel makes money by using high frequency trades. They make money by using high speed internet connection to take advantage of small differences in bid/ask prices that exist because of high volume trades. Citadel is an institutional investor that participates in dark pools Institutional investors are the intended customers who are the only participants in the dark pools. Citadel participates in Dark pools which are private markets that allow large companies to trade millions of shares of stocks at one time without the large trade shocking the market for retail investors. The large institutional investors could take advantage of the options market. Their large trades occur throughout a long period of time to make the trades invisible to the retail investors. The participants in the dark pools would be able to reverse engineer the algorithm they made to sell a large number of shares in the dark pool to leverage the options markets that are available to the general public. The dark pool participants are relying on high fiber optic cables that are routed to the public markets. The shorter the cable, the more leverage they have over other institutional investors. The major competitors in the high frequency trading domain are Virtu Financial, Tower Research Capital, IMC, and Tradebot.
